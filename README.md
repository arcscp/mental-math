## Mental Math

This project was created to help teach myself the ReactJS framework. It is a game where you answer math problems quickly and advance to the next level before the timer runs out. If the timer runs out or if too many wrong answers are given, the game ends.

## Future Versions

Planned future releases will include:
	- More levels with increasing numbers
	- Additional operators that can be cycled in to add more of a challenge
	- Improved animation/effects
	- A 'Freeze' meter to charge and use that will let you freeze/unfreeze the timer
