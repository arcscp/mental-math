## Mental Math

This project was created to help teach myself the ReactJS framework. It is a game where you answer math problems quickly and advance to the next level before the timer runs out. If the timer runs out or if too many wrong answers are given, the game ends.

## How To Play

When the application is started, at the title screen click 'Start Game'. You will be brought to the first level and the timer will begin counting down (the orange meter). You'll have to answer a random equation to fill the green meter, which will bring you to the next level and reset the timer. Answer 3 questions correctly to fill the meter. Beat levl 10 to win the game.

If you answer a question incorrectly, it will fill the red meter. Answer 2 questions incorrectly and the game ends. Additionally, if the timer reaches 0, the game ends. The timer speed will increase with each level. The game is fairly easy until the final level. Difficulty increases are planned for the future.

## Future Versions

Planned future releases will include:
* More levels with increasing numbers
* Additional operators that can be cycled in to add more of a challenge
* Improved animation/effects
* A 'Freeze' meter to charge and use that will let you freeze/unfreeze the timer
